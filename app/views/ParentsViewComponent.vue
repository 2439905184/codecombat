        h3 The most effective way to learn type based code
        p Students will cover material aligned with national curriculum standards, covering topics from computational thinking and algorithms, to big data and cybersecurity. They will come out having a grasp on how the internet of things works, and the personal and global impact of computer science.

        p Computer Science isn’t just about coding and engineering, but also about learning how to navigate and become citizens in the digital world. The problem-to-solution methods taught by programming are something something blah blah blah just a few more words come on brain think of things

        p CodeCombat isn’t just more homework, it’s a game that your kids will love to play. We know how important fun and engagement is for the developing brain, so we’ve packed in as much learning as any other CS classroom, while wrapping it up in a game they love. Your kids are the heroes of the future, they might as well have fun while they’re doing it.

Coding knowledge is needed for the interpretation and use of medical imaging, and Google has recently launched an AI to help doctors make better decisions.

        p There’s a reason we moved away from blackboard learning. Sure it may look like a game, but multiple studies repeatedly found that game based learning promoted cognitive development in kids, while also proving to be more effective in helping students learn and retain knowledge, concentrate and perform at a higher level of achievement.
        p Game based learning is also good for teaching resilience, cognitive reasoning, and develop executive functions. Early studies have even shown the effectiveness of using games to teach science. What all this means is that educational games can be the most effective method for teaching kids to be the creators of their best future.

      .col-lg-6.col-md-12.col-sm-12
        p We’re in almost 14,000 schools across the work and in 190 many countries because we know that in the future coding is going to be as fundamental a school as learning to read and write. Unfortunately, schools often find it difficult to find computer science teachers who can teach CS to an entire study body. We’ve worked closely with teachers to design and develop our levels, but your kids need <b>you</b> to help them learn. Neuroscience and researchers are in agreement about the positive effects of game based learning for kids, but <b>only</b> when it’s implemented correctly. Teacher participation is critical in ensuring those positive outcomes, so WE NEED YOUR HELP to create that connection between students and teachers.

        h4 Level up computer science education in and out of the classroom
        p We’ve built mechanics so that kids learn coding in a way that’s cross translational,  meaning that they know more than just how to pass our levels. These are actual skills that can be applied outside of the game.
        p We have an amazing education specialist on our team who works closely with teachers to meet children where they are in the educational landscape and CodeCombat is a College Board endorsed provider for AP Computer Science principles.

        h4 How and Why We Began
        p 30% of teenagers in secondary school fail to reach proficiency in one subject across maths, reading, or science. We believe in doing better for our kids. So we created CodeCombat. CodeCombat was built to be the most engaging way to teach coding to students. A 2016 survey showed that 64% of girls in 3-5th grade want to learn how to code and 2/3rds of all students were asking for more edtech to be available in their school. There were 7 million job openings in 2015 required coding skills and with barriers to entry becoming higher, we built codecombat to because every child should be given a chance to create their best future.

        h4 We’re parents too
        p Here at CodeCombat, we’re experts in the CS field. Our CEO, Nick, graduated Summa Cum Laude from Oberlin College in 2008. Our CTO, Matt, has been building software for the past 15 years and started off at Microsoft.
        p But more than that, we’re parents too. Nick and Matt each have two growing superheros. At CodeCombat we’re parents. We’re coders. But most of all, we’re people who believe in giving our kids the best opportunity for success in whatever it is they decide to do.
